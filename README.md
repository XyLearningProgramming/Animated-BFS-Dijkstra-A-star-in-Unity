# Animated Path Finding Algorithem BFS Dijkstra A-star

## PathFindingAlgorithmCombined

### Description
This is a Unity project that animates three common pathfinding algorithm: BFS, Dijkstra, and A-star. It has different models (house, tent, train tracks, gate) and visual effects (plasma) to visualize the pathfinding process.
The pathfinding begins with a glowing start gate. Exploration team builds tents when they first reaches a cell ("open-list"). Then cell already explored are filled with house ("close-list"). Finally, rail tracks is built on the best path found and our train goes to the destination glowing red light.
When first learned these algorithm, I always want to have a direct and appealing visualization of them. Today, I did that myself. Anyone is welcome to download and play with it in Unity.
Here are some classical scenes I pre-made in the project to show differences between these algorithms.

And with plasma when exploring new locations:
